h1. Candid Words

This is a basic algorithm for generating a list of Wordle candidates based on yellow and green tiles.

h2. Building

You will need a C++11 compiler, for instance @g++ -std=c++11@. If you want to use a specific word list, save it as a plaintext file at 'words.txt' and run @convert.py@ before compiling the program.
